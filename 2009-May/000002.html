Sorry to take so long to reply, but I was out of town. You can
probably use vl-hot on Debian, or any typical distro, though AFAIK it
has only been tested on VL and Slackware.

The core of vl-hot is a set of bash scripts, so no compilation is
needed. A manual installation guide is(was?) on the old GoogleCode
project page, which I can unfortunately no longer access, since Google
has blocked access from my country (The reason I moved to Berlios).
Anyway, the simplest way to figure out where everything should go is
to download the latest VL packages for vl-hot and vl-hot-config from
Berlios and open them in an archiver utility. The scripts are in the
vl-hot subdirectory of the project and you will also need to set up
the udev rules from the udev-rules subdirectory as well as the config
files in the conf subdirectory.

The configuration GUI is a different matter, as it is programmed in
Gambas2. You need to install Gambas2 for your distro and compile the
project source code (which resides in the vl-hot-config subdirectory
of the project). There are also desktop launcher files as well as
icons and sounds to install.

You will need to download the source code from the Berlios subversion
repository for the project, as I have not set it up to release source
tarballs yet. Simply set up an empty working directory and execute the
following command in a terminal inside that directory:

svn checkout <A HREF="http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/vl-hot/trunk">http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/vl-hot/trunk</A>

You may instead wish to download the latest release tag, from
<A HREF="http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/vl-hot/tags/release-x.x.x">http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/vl-hot/tags/release-x.x.x</A>
(currently 2.0.0).

You may contact me directly for any further questions, etc.

Regards,
Joe1962
