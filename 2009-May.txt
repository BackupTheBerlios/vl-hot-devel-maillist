Subject: [vl-hot-devel] how to make vl-hot for debain ?
Message-ID: <4A0825D8.2070403@infoservices.in>

Dear list,

I have recently come to know about the vl-hot ( vxmount as known
presently ). I am very much interested to try this tool. I personally
work to design light-weight linux system and continuously searching for
light weight tools. My previous work on this direction can be seen at

http://jbakshi.50webs.com/linuxproject.html

devicekit is already the replacement of HAL but I wonder how fast it can
run w.r.t  HAL. On the other hand vl-hot is really a great promising
tool if we just overlook the CD/DVD detection ( as udev can't generate
event for this ).  But after searching lot I have not found any source
which can be used to compile  vl-hot on other distro. I like to use
vl-hot in debian. How can I get the source or is there already any .deb
package for it ? Also like to know how vl-hot wil work with idesk ? My
combination is  icewm+idesk

Kindly suggest.
Thanks

Sorry to take so long to reply, but I was out of town. You can
probably use vl-hot on Debian, or any typical distro, though AFAIK it
has only been tested on VL and Slackware.

The core of vl-hot is a set of bash scripts, so no compilation is
needed. A manual installation guide is(was?) on the old GoogleCode
project page, which I can unfortunately no longer access, since Google
has blocked access from my country (The reason I moved to Berlios).
Anyway, the simplest way to figure out where everything should go is
to download the latest VL packages for vl-hot and vl-hot-config from
Berlios and open them in an archiver utility. The scripts are in the
vl-hot subdirectory of the project and you will also need to set up
the udev rules from the udev-rules subdirectory as well as the config
files in the conf subdirectory.

The configuration GUI is a different matter, as it is programmed in
Gambas2. You need to install Gambas2 for your distro and compile the
project source code (which resides in the vl-hot-config subdirectory
of the project). There are also desktop launcher files as well as
icons and sounds to install.

You will need to download the source code from the Berlios subversion
repository for the project, as I have not set it up to release source
tarballs yet. Simply set up an empty working directory and execute the
following command in a terminal inside that directory:

svn checkout http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/vl-hot/trunk

You may instead wish to download the latest release tag, from
http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/vl-hot/tags/release-x.x.x
(currently 2.0.0).

You may contact me directly for any further questions, etc.

Joe1962

Hello Jose,

thanks a lot for your kind and descriptive email. I am really interested
to use vl-hot in debian as well as make a .deb package so that debian
users can test it.  I have already downloaded the latest release version
2.0.

1> I have found udev-rules/10-vl-hot.rules.   I think I should place it
in my udev-rules directory

2> there is a conf directory containing

        vl-hot.conf  vl-hot_names.conf


It seems  vl-hot.conf has icon and sound path with some other
configuration like atime etc........        and    vl-hot_names.conf
identify devices with ID ( ? not sure ).  where to place  these 2 files ?

3> launchers has KDE Desktop configuration, right ? My combination is
icewm +idesk.  please help

4> vl-hot folder has mount/unmount script for Desktop icons I think. How
to call these ?

Thanks once again :-)
